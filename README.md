# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project predicts house prices using **Multiple Linear Regression**.
It analyzes how factors like **area, bedrooms, bathrooms, house age, and city** influence property prices.

The project covers the complete Data Analytics workflow:

* Data Cleaning
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature Engineering
* Model Building
* Model Evaluation

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

To build a regression model that predicts **house prices** based on multiple independent variables and identifies the most influential factors affecting price.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains **1000 rows** with the following features:

* Area_sqft
* Bedrooms
* Bathrooms
* Age_of_house
* City
* Price (Target Variable)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn

---

## ⚙️ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning

* Checked missing values
* Removed duplicates
* Corrected data types

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Correlation heatmap
* Distribution plots
* Feature vs Price analysis

### 3. Feature Engineering

* Converted categorical variable **City → Dummy variables**

### 4. Model Building

* Applied **Multiple Linear Regression**
* Train-Test Split (80% / 20%)

### 5. Model Evaluation

Performance measured using:

* MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
* MSE (Mean Squared Error)
* RMSE
* R² Score

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Area has the highest impact on price
* More bedrooms & bathrooms increase house value
* Older houses tend to have lower prices
* Location significantly affects price variation
